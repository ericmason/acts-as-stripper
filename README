ActsAsStripper
==============

The trailing or leading white spaces in your form fields can be annoying at times. This Rails plugin is created to ease your pain.


Example
=======

If you have a user model, simply add acts_as_stripper, and all the white spaces in your form fields will be stripped away!

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      acts_as_stripper
    end

Say that someone enters '  Vancouver, Canada   ' as a location, this plugin will strip away the white leading and trailing white spaces and store simply 'Vancouver, Canada' for the location field.
